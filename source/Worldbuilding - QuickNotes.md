- Known world is a part of a continent, dangerous outside the known regions for various reasons, climate being one of them
- North is more nordic, extremely cold in winters, in the north exist only tough and resiliant people
- South is arabic, extremly hot in summers, south is inhabited by extremely xenophobic, proficient tribal warriors that are known to the whole world (I'd like for their culture to be complex and invert some natural things for average human to the point of extremes, maybe with deadly consequences)
- West is mainly coastal, near the sea, populated by largest kingdom in the continent, inspired by a Roman Empire but modernized to reach the average XV century technology, with respect towards fantasy elements such as magic
- East is covered in very dense and deep forests and steep mountains, place know for nature's display of magic, most people who lived there left because nature seems to grow out, as if sentient or some magic propelled it to cover everything. It's slow and some tried to stop it, but something happens to them (?)
- Magic is very complex, known to be at times dangerous and has various aspects and ways to learn or use it
- World is mostly religious as Gods are almost for certain known to be real. In the world there are scattered temples of various deities of various alignments. However usually God's signs are indirect, as symbols, metaphores, they do not show themselves directly besides dreams 
- In the world there are scattered ancient statues of heroes chosen by their gods; their postures and location of the statues usually fit to the legend or myth of how they aided their god; what noone knows and nor players will is that all of those statues are actually the heroes, that can be revived, released from their stone form
- political scene is complex, there is a war brewing between different kingdoms, based on growing hatred for their history and actions that were never forgotten
