In a land of stark contrasts and ancient enmities, the known world teeters on the precipice of war. From the frostbitten North to the sun-scorched South, resilient cultures clash and conspire, each driven by blood-soaked histories and unyielding pride.  The West's grand Empire is promising a stable future, filled with arcane power and knowledge. The Free Cities Alliance, a beacon of freedom and mercantile power, stands as a crossroads of ambition and subterfuge, while the East's Verdant Expanse harbors mystical secrets deep in its wilderness. As old grudges fester and new alliances form, the continent simmers with restless tension, where every faction, bound by duty, survival, or vengeance, maneuvers in the shadows, poised for the inevitable reckoning, fearing much worse. 


#### Northern Lands

-   The Northern people are known as the Skarnyr. They live in closely-knit clans, each led by a Jarl. The harsh climate has fostered a deep sense of community and mutual reliance. Hospitality is sacred; even an enemy is given shelter during a blizzard. Law and tradition is held as close to the heart of every Skarnyr as their honor and family.

**Economy and Trade:**
-   Their economy is based on fishing, hunting, and trading furs and crafted goods. They have limited agriculture due to the short growing season, relying instead on hardy root vegetables and grains like barley.
- **Unique Craftsmanship:** Skarnyr are renowned for their intricate wood carvings and jewelry made from walrus ivory and whalebone.
- **Exceptional Metalurgy** Skarnyr learnt how to forge most resiliant metals in the know world despite their extreme freezing temperatures. To carry a blade forged by master Skarnyr Forge is to carry a life-long friend near your side. It is very common for Skarnyr families to carry blades for generations, passed by forefathers to children. To shatter such blade in battle is a symbol of great strength of the opponents and symbol of much needed change in the clan. Some clans always forge new blades for their kin, asking ancestors to bless them for the blood they shall spill. Because of the sanctity and respect towards their weapons, Skarnyr rarely sell their craft and if they do, extremely pricey. 

-   **Internal Politics:** Clans vie for resources and prestige, often resorting to raids and skirmishes to settle disputes. Leadership is based on martial prowess and ancestral lineage. High King of Skarnyrs is chosen from all jarls when previous one dies or is considered weak. No matter for which purpose, the moment is truly grand and sometimes bloody. For all clans and all jarls always consider themselves a better choice including previous High King if still alive. Usually a concensus is reached at one point or the other and a new High King is chosen. This internal fighting is the only thing, in the eyes of Western Empire, which holds Skarnyrs from uniting and expanding their lands. 

-   **Relations:** Tensions are rising with the Western Empire due to old borders being considered stolen and competing claims over northern territories. As the new High King just taken over the rule, Empire's diplomats are pulling all strings they can to not intice war.

-   **Rituals and Traditions:** 
One of Skarnyrs many rituals and traditions is the Ensfare, "Winter Walk", a coming-of-age ceremony where young adults must survive a night alone in the deep north during the coldest part of winter called Skogis. Survival is seen as a sign of the gods' favor.

Common ritual during common and large feasts that happen in hottest days of the year, which in the North are still cold, is for two men, wanting to prove their strength to brawl in freshly cut open ice lake. Waist deep in ice cold water, they fight until one surrenders or looses conciousness. Named Frostslag in loose translation means "Ice Cold Fist".


#### Southern Lands

**Culture and Society:**

-   The Southern people, known as the Qavari, live in fiercely independent tribes. Each tribe led by a council of elders, with decisions often made through intense. For Qavari respect for elders and laws is at highest level, and disrespect to any can even end in banishment to the desert or shaming ceremony and death.

-   **Social Structure:** Qavari society is heavily focused on survival and respect and desert is merciless to anyone who has none. Centuries of living in these conditions taught Qavari both. Those who defend and provide to the tribe are held at the top of their society. Despite most of them being men, women do happen to follow the Warrior's Path - a extremly dangerous and demanding path. 

**Traditions and Rituals:**

-   **Deadly Customs:** They have a practice known as Quen'vad  "Blood Oath" where personal and tribal oaths are sealed with a blood ritual. Breaking such an oath is punishable by death, as it is seen as an highest level of respect. True Qavari would die rather than break such oath.
-   Qavari warriors undergo the "Trials of the Sun". Details of the passage are known only to the master and the student. Each deciple walking the Warrior's Path after years of brutal training take their master's test. To pass the test is to take a Blood Oath.

-   **Taboos and Traditions:** Qavari culture reveres silence during meals as a mark of respect for the food and those who prepare it. Hospitality is reserved only for esteemed guests, and outsiders are often met with suspicion. Breaking food taboos is considered sacrilegious and can lead to severe punishments.

- Internal Politics: Respect and tradition being held so high caused for many grudges to be formed between many of the tribes. For centuries now different tribes of Qavari are refusing to unite under one blade, for a sin of one long-forgoten ancestor or the other. 

- Relations: There is no region, folk or kingdom that has not gave a reason for some Qavari tribe to hold a grudge. Luckily for other kingdoms the amount of Qavari tribes is as grand as their ability to remember wrongdoings.

The kingdom's capital is home to the Grand Academy, the largest institution for magical education, amongside numerous mage guilds. These guilds hold significant political power and influence. Despite great amount of progress that they bring to the arcane knowledge and magical prowess they are often criticized for ignorance towards other types of magic. Institutions face often spite for focusing on only one aspect of magic, going as far as to calling it the only true magic.

- **Military:** The Empire's army is bolstered by battlemages and enchanted weapons, making it a formidable force.

#### Eastern Wilds

#### Eastern Wilds

-   The Eastern region, known as the Verdant Expanse, is a place where nature's magic is rampant. The forests are home to ancient and unknown creatures, trees and forgotten relics of past that guard the land fiercely. Wilderness that inhabits this land is slowly trying to expand as if sentient, remembering faults and wrongdoings of the past. It is believed that the Verdant Expanse was once a kingdom that fell due to a curse. Wheter the curse is real and justified or its just a children story, one fact remains - Eastern Wilds is incredibly dangerous place. Currently Eastern Region is vastly populated by freefolk, various creatures, from elves and humans to goblins and halflings. Those who live near The Wild are calm and respectful people. Living slowly with great respect towards nature, usually integrating their towns and cities with forests. It is well known that for the best alchemy, ingredients and plants one should search for a specialist form the East. 
-   The overgrowth of nature is seen as both a blessing and a curse. While it provides abundant resources, growing faster than it should, it also harbors dangers such as predatory plants and territorial magical beasts. Those who greedily start cutting into the forest had felt its wrath. Despite its dangers it is common for an armed lumber teams from farther cities to come and gather wood from the Verdant Expanse, as its' wood contains incredible properties.
-   **Mysterious Disappearances:** Many who venture into the Verdant Expanse do not return. Legends say that those who disturb the balance of nature are claimed by the forest, either transformed into part of the flora or maybe spirited away to another realm. Rarely does it happen for one to come back, and once they do they aren't the same.

-   **Internal Politics:** Eastern Duchy, once great and powerful had declined and split centuries ago. Now, split into different duchies, they aim to provide and survive in their lands. People of the East are as split as their Duchy. Some support only their duches, gave up the idea of once again achieving greatness. Some beleive that despite being divided they are still strong, and if need arises, duches will come together to protect whats theirs. Other people still dream of regaining their lost prowess, of supporting a new Great Duch who will lead them into a new golden age. None of current duches however is capable of the task. While the idea of what's to come is unlcear one is certain - cumulated strength of the East is power to be feared of. 
-   **Relations:** They are wary of all external powers, viewing them as potential threats to their heritage, either mystical or as duchy. While this cannot be said for certain about all duchies, it can be expected.
### Mercantile Coalition (Central City-States):
The central region, known as the Mercantile Coalition, is a collection of city-states governed by powerful trade guilds. Each city-state is autonomous, led by a Guild Master.
- **Diverse Population:** The region boasts a diverse populace due to its central trade routes and fertile lands.
- **High Council**: Council had been created decades ago after internal conflicts became a serious problem within the Coalition. Since then Council's rule is continuusly perfected, it gaining profit from cumulative prosperity of all city-states. Becoming a member of the Council is to have access to unimaginable levels of riches only equal on the level of responsibilities and danger that comes with. Only the best of the traders, understanding greatest of scales and tiniest of details about trade can begin dream of becoming a member.
- **Internal Politics:** Highly competitive, with constant diplomatic maneuvering among the Guild Masters who all agreed to work together under common law upheld by a Council. Council constantly invents, modifies and improves upon common, regional and trade law. Law being constantly in flux, having all masters argue, point out errors, frauds and unjustice of others to the Council creates a unique dynamic. Such dynamic has created a somewhat just and free network of cities with suprisingly fair market prices and incredibly vast range of items to be bought. At the end of the day rule and law of each master is different between all city-states, but one thing is certain - work and gold is plenty. All you need is to find a way to reach it before others do.
- **Relations:** Neutral and pragmatic, focused on maintaining trade and economic stability. Often chosen as a neutral ground between rivals to settle things peacefully.
- **Opinion on Others:** It is very common in Mercentile Coalition to change opinion as quickly as money changes hands. To hold a grudge against one or the other is to cut off from the potential profit or supply of merchendise that could come. Because of that despite prejudice coming from past, present or potential future, most do not care who you are or where you from. 

- **Economy and Trade:**

The Coalition thrives on taxing trade routes and offering extremly diverse goods. Its markets are renowned for items from all over the continent, from common to almost mythical items.
#### Religion and Deities

**Religious Practices:**
- Religion in the known land is as common as food. To refuse existance of gods is to refuse the need to breathe. Although pantheon is vast, gods do not reveal themselves to mortals. If its enforced or vouluntary is a matter of debate depending on god or goddess or scholar you talk with. Despite that, many omens, miracles, symbols, blessings, dreams and in rare cases gifts are bestowed from gods to those who believe. 
-  Many regions are dominated by different deities, but there is a pantheon that is universally acknowledged. Nature of those deities is vast, their ideas, needs and motivation as complex as the trails they might put mortals through. Religious festivals and rituals are central to daily life, with temples serving as community hubs. 
-   **Chosen:** while not directly acting on the world, gods do affect the known land. For this a mortal might be picked by a god; one is ordered to fulfuill their mission they ultimately becoming their Chosen. No matter which deity asks, the holy mission bestowed upon the Chosen is usually an impossible to fulfill task, spaning decades of difficult trails, decisions and acts. However those who are chosen are remembered for centuries and for a good reason - for once they are gone a large statue of black stone appears, a statue of a Chosen. Sometims easier and sometimes harder to differentiate which Chosen is depicted on the statue. These are shrouded in mystery as there are very few things that are known about them and depending on how the hero was remembered can be a cult gathering spot or a forgotten, overgrown symbol of a hated Chosen. After milenia, there are many statues that were forgotten to time and people for various reasons. Destruction of such statue is sometimes as easy as pushing them over or next to impossible. What causes them to be easy to shatter or to be as unbreakable as the hearts of those they depict is unknown. It is commonly said that statues are a way to directly speak to given Chosen who can bring the prayer to the god. It is believed that in times of great need, these heroes will awaken to aid the world once more although scholars defute this idea, suggesting that the statues themselves have arcane properties, which slowly deflate.
